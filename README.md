# A-Case-Study-on-ATLIQ-Hotel-Analysis
I worked with ATLIQ Hotel, a 4-star Hotel business in India, analyzing data from May 2022 to July 2022 using SQL logic in Python to find query solutions. I also utilized Python visualization libraries to visualize the query results. Additionally, I created a Power BI dashboard incorporating key measures such as ADR, DSRN, and DBRN.
